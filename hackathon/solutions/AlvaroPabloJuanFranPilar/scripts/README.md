# CLI Application 

Implement a CLI Program that wraps our Pokedex.

We should be able to trigger it through:
```
python cli.py --img-url "https://alfabetajuega.com/hero/2019/03/Squirtle-Looking-Happy.jpg?width=1200&aspect_ratio=16:9"
```

Response should be something like:
```
ðŸŽ¯ The closest Pokemon is: squirtle
```
